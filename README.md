# OneNote Electron Wrapper

Wraps around OneNote online using electron and trims out the redundant UI elements.

Note that in order to modify the UI, WebSecurity is disabled. Use at your own risk.

Originally based on https://github.com/peterforgacs/electron-onenote but more like a complete rewrite now.
